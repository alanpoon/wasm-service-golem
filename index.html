  <h1>HTMLX + Service Workers + WebAssembly + Rust</h1>
  <div>
    This is a simple proof of concept that shows how you could use
    <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a> and Rust for frontend development.
    The basic idea in HTMX is that a webserver is being called on interactions
    with DOM elements, and returning back snippets of HTML that will replace
    certain DOM elements. Instead of going to a real web serviceWorker this
    project shows how service workers can intercept calls to a server and
    return back responses driven from WebAssembly instead.
