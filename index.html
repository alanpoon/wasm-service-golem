    <h1>HTMLX + Service Workers + WebAssembly + Rust</h1>
    <div>
      This is a simple proof of concept that shows how you could use
      <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a> and Rust for frontend development.
      The basic idea in HTMX is that a webserver is being called on interactions
      with DOM elements, and returning back snippets of HTML that will replace
      certain DOM elements. Instead of going to a real web serviceWorker this
      project shows how service workers can intercept calls to a server and
      return back responses driven from WebAssembly instead.
